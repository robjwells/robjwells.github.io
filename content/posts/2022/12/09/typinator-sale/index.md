Long time! Lots to talk about, some point soon.

In the mean time, [Typinator][] is currently on sale (along with all ergonis
software), at 30% off, to celebrate the snazzy new ergonis website.

I've much more to say about Typinator, but in short: I was a TextExpander user
for a long time, but grew hesitant to use it because it was slow and awkward.

Typinator is not! It's fast and flexible. I switched in March 2021 and I use it
a lot more than I did TextExpander, and creating new snippets is
straightforward and pleasant. The snippet search is also really fast and
responsive.

The snippet language differs from TextExpander's, but it's easy to get used to.

[Do give it a try!][Typinator]
