<h2><strong>Olivia on James</strong></h2> <p><strong>First impressions? </strong>Smart, polite, friendly smile, relaxed. I thought, "Great, I'll be in good company this evening!"<br/><strong>What did you talk about? </strong>Early ambitions to work in the arts, old cinemas, theatres and pubs, home ownership, Eddie Izzard's theory on cat psychology, analysing Harry Potter books and films; plus sailing stories and how Jaws has traumatised us both for life. We had a lot in common.<br/><strong>Any awkward moments? </strong>We did think it funny that we were so well attended by all the restaurant staff. I think they were intrigued to see how we were getting on.<br/><strong>Good table manners?</strong> Flawless, and it was a good team effort in choosing a nice wine.<br/><strong>Best thing about him? </strong>He is passionate about his interests and he's hilarious, easy to chat to and a gentleman.<br/><strong>Did you go on somewhere? </strong>No, we were having such a good time it was closing time before we knew it.<br/><strong>Marks out of 10? </strong>I can't think of anything that would lose him a point.<br/><strong>Would you meet again? </strong>We said we would and exchanged numbers, so we'll see!</p> <h2><strong>James on Olivia</strong></h2> <p><strong>First impressions? </strong>Strikingly pretty. I arrived early, but she was already there. She looked great, and the restaurant lighting made the scene look like a Vettriano painting.<br/><strong>What did you talk about? </strong>Cubism, Aperol, sailing, synaesthesia, the size of Yorkshire, Venice, Harry Potter, Peggy Guggenheim, marathon training, Glasgow, siblings, sleeper trains, bleak landscapes, the attentiveness of the staff, basking sharks.<br/><strong>Any awkward moments? </strong>Not that I remember. <br/><strong>Good table manners? </strong>Impeccable.<br/><strong>Best thing about her? </strong>We talked nonstop – one of the most enjoyable conversations I've had.<br/><strong>Did you go on somewhere? </strong>No. We left after everyone had gone and the restaurant started to close at 12.30.<br/><strong>Marks out of 10? </strong>9.<br/><strong>Would you meet again? </strong>We are going for drinks soon.</p> <p>• Olivia and James ate at <a href="http://www.samsbrasserie.co.uk/" title="">Sam's Brasserie</a>, London W4.</p> <p>Fancy a blind date?

<h2><strong>Zarine on Thomas</strong></h2> <p><strong>First impressions? </strong>Quite nervous, but easy to talk to, nicely dressed, unpretentious and friendly.<br/><strong>What did you talk about? </strong>Travel, our nieces and nephews, university, concerts, my dubious taste in music – his words, not mine, although confessing my love for Take That early on in the evening probably didn't help – the weird and wonderful world of internet dating… <br/><strong>Any awkward moments? </strong>Only when trying to decipher what most of the food on the menu was.<br/><strong>Good table manners?</strong> Very polite indeed, especially when I asked to try his food.<br/><strong>Best thing about him? </strong>His smile and his dry sense of humour.<br/><strong>Did you go on somewhere? </strong>No<br/><strong>Marks out of 10? </strong>Can I plead the Fifth?<br/><strong>Would you meet again? </strong>Only as friends. We've been in touch and I'd meet up again, but there was no attraction between us.</p> <h2><strong>Thomas on Zarine</strong></h2> <p><strong>First impressions? </strong>I was pleasantly surprised: Zarine was well-dressed, with a nice smile and easy on the eye.<br/><strong>What did you talk about? </strong>The usual: travel, family, university, music tastes (she likes Take That, but each to their own). And we both confessed to enjoying the TV show <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/mistresses/" title="">Mistresses</a>.<br/><strong>Any awkward moments? </strong>No uncomfortable silences or awkward moments – Zarine was easy to talk to.<br/><strong>Good table manners? </strong>Impeccable. We shared our dishes and enjoyed the food.<br/><strong>Best thing about her? </strong>She's lived abroad and speaks Spanish. Hearing about the places she's explored was fascinating.<br/><strong>Did you go on somewhere? </strong>We went to the station and got the same tube. I asked her to text me to let me know she got back safely, and she did.<br/><strong>Marks out of 10?</strong> 8.<br/><strong>Would you meet again? </strong>Defintely maybe.</p> <p>• Zarine and Thomas ate at <a href="http://www.shaka-zulu.com" title="">Shaka Zulu</a>, London NW1, shaka-zulu.com.</p> <p>Fancy a blind date?

<h2><strong>Lucy on Jay</strong></h2> <p><strong>First impressions?</strong><br/><strong> </strong>Seemed comfortable in his own skin and was very easy to talk to. Because of that, any initial nerves disappeared quickly.<br/><strong>What did you talk about?</strong><br/><strong> </strong>The frustrations of the probation system, the thrill of working with wolves, the importance of work-life balance, <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/images?q=Curly+Wurly&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;source=univ&amp;ei=OKt7TOXFHNOa4Aa40JG6Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=image_result_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQsAQwAA&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=1008" title="">Curly Wurlys</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routemaster" title="">Routemasters</a>, America.<br/><strong>Any awkward moments?</strong><br/><strong> </strong>I think he'd have preferred red wine.<br/><strong>Good table manners?</strong><br/><strong> </strong>Yes, especially as the food was a bit fiddly.<br/><strong>Best thing about him?</strong><br/><strong> </strong>It's nice to meet someone who knows what they're about, and we did have a lot of similar interests. He's very open about himself and is probably the sort of person people feel able to say anything to.<br/><strong>Did you go on somewhere?</strong><br/><strong> </strong>Nope. My fault: it had been a hard week!<br/><strong>Marks out of 10? </strong>9.<br/><strong>Would you meet again?</strong><br/><strong> </strong>Maybe.</p> <h2><strong>Jay on Lucy</strong></h2> <p><strong>First impressions?</strong><br/> That I had been stood up – I sat at the round table on my own for 15 minutes. I felt a bit like King Arthur, minus his knights. But waiting patiently is easier when you have a Jack Daniel's-inspired cocktail. Thankfully, she arrived and I remember thinking, "She's a tall lass."<br/><strong>What did you talk about?</strong><br/><strong> </strong>Work, travel, the state of the probation service, pop-up restaurants, sport and writing.<br/><strong>Any awkward moments?</strong><br/><strong> </strong>I didn't think so.<br/><strong>Good table manners?</strong><br/> Yes, and her chopstick skills were a delight to watch – better than my nonexistent ones!<br/><strong>Best thing about her?</strong><br/> She seemed relaxed and appeared to enjoy the setting as the trains went by in the background of this swanky restaurant.<br/><strong>Did you go on somewhere?</strong><br/> No. <br/><strong>Marks out of 10?</strong> 7.<br/><strong>Would you meet again?</strong><br/><strong> </strong>Maybe, but just as friends.</p> <p>• Jay and Lucy ate at <a href="http://www.gilgameshbar.com/" title="">Gilgamesh</a>, London, NW1.

<h2>Ruth on Richard<br/></h2> <strong>First impressions?</strong> <br/>Eww, big beard. <br/> <strong>What did you talk about?</strong> <br/> <a href="http://www.robin-hoods-bay.co.uk/" title="">Robin Hood's Bay</a>, other places we've visited or would like to visit, quirky music, our jobs, the attentiveness of our waiter and the size of his sausage platter. <br/> <strong>Any awkward moments?</strong> <br/>I don't think so. <br/> <strong>Good table manners?</strong> <br/>He tried to pick his teeth with his fingers and played with his beard occasionally. <br/> <strong>Best thing about him?</strong> <br/>His creative work with young people; nice eyes (and possibly a nice face, but I couldn't see it). <br/> <strong>Did you go on somewhere?</strong> <br/>No, I had to get the last train home. <br/> <strong>Marks out of 10?</strong> 5. <br/> <strong>Would you meet again?</strong> <br/>No, the search continues. <h2>Richard on Ruth</h2> <strong>First impressions? </strong> <br/>Not my type. She seemed a little apprehensive, which is no surprise given my ridiculous facial hair. <br/> <strong>What did you talk about? </strong> <br/>Reading, what bits of the Guardian we read in what order, our mutual love of walking in the Yorkshire Dales. We also chatted about Ruth's attention to detail, although I promised not to divulge exact details. <br/> <strong>Any awkward moments? </strong> <br/>The evening flowed quite well, but when we parted I went to give her a friendly kiss on the cheek and she jerked her head sideways. <br/> <strong>Good table manners?</strong> <br/> Yes, faultless. <br/> <strong>Best thing about her? </strong> <br/>She didn't want to try my lime pie dessert. <br/> <strong>Did you go on somewhere? </strong> <br/>No, she had to get the last train. <br/> <strong>Marks out of 10? </strong> <br/>6 for fanciability and chemistry, and 10 for still being there when I returned from the loo. <br/> <strong>Would you meet again?</strong> <br/>I did take her number. <p><strong>• </strong>Ruth and Richard ate at <a href="http://www.gauchorestaurants.co.uk/restaurants/restaurant.php?id=leeds" title="">Gaucho</a>, Leeds.</p> <p> Fancy a blind date?

<h2>Sheila Hancock, 77</h2> <p>Actor and author. She is currently starring in <a href="http://www.sisteractthemusical.com/cast/sheila-hancock.php" title="">Sister Act</a>, and has just finished a stint as a judge on <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/apr/13/sheila-hancock-over-the-rainbow" title="">Somewhere Over The Rainbow</a>. She was married to the actor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Thaw" title="">John Thaw</a> from 1973 until his death in 2002, since when she has been single. Her bestselling book, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_of_Us:_My_Life_with_John_Thaw" title="">The Two Of Us</a>, described their 28-year marriage, and was followed by <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Just-Me-Sheila-Hancock/dp/0747598509/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1276682597&amp;sr=8-1">Just Me</a>, her account of coming to terms with widowhood.</p> <p><strong>Did you recognise your date?</strong><br/>Yes, he was lurking by the entrance and I guessed he was my date. He had disappeared by the time I parked my car, so I thought he had done a runner when he saw me. He hadn't.<br/><strong>First impressions? </strong>He's very Italian.<br/><strong>What did you talk about? </strong>His romantic love life. His new house and kitchen. Depression, marriage, divorce and fungi.<br/><strong>Any awkward moments? </strong>I felt pretty idiotic when I arrived.<br/><strong>Good table manners? </strong>Impeccable. Lovely old-fashioned courtesy all round.<br/><strong>Best thing about him? </strong>His lovely old-fashioned courtesy and confidence with waiters over food.<br/><strong>Did you go on somewhere? </strong>Nope. Both too busy.<br/><strong>Marks out of 10?</strong><br/>I wouldn't dream of giving any human being marks out of 10 on two hours' acquaintance.<br/><strong>Would you meet again? </strong>Highly unlikely. I think he prefers a younger model.</p> <h2><a href="http://www.antonio-carluccio.com/" title="">Antonio Carluccio</a>, 73</h2> <p>Chef and author of 13 cookery books, he is former director of the <a href="http://www.carluccios.com/" title="">Carluccio's</a> chain of delis and restaurants and continues to work with the team on development. He has been single for two years.</p> <p><strong>Did you recognise her? </strong>Yes, I recognised her immediately.<br/><strong>First impressions? </strong>Well, I knew her from performing, but not very well. We'd never met before. But I knew what she was about and thought she's lovely. I could see she is really a great woman.<br/><strong>What did you talk about? </strong>Different things: about me, about her, about depression, about a lot of things. We knew a little bit of each other and we covered a range.<br/><strong>Any awkward moments? </strong>No, not at all. <br/><strong>Good table manners?</strong><br/>Oh yes, yes, yes. She's lovely. A dame.<br/><strong>Best thing about her? </strong>Her sophisticated simplicity.<br/><strong>Did you go on somewhere? </strong>No, she had to rush away to some appointment. She's very busy. She told me all that she does, and it's remarkable.<br/><strong>Marks out of 10? </strong>9. It was very, very nice meeting her.<br/><strong>Will you meet again?</strong><br/>Oh yes. Not to lead to anything special, but as good friends probably. She's invited me to see the show she is in.</p> <p>Sheila and Antonio ate at <a href="http://www.palm-court.co.uk/" title="">Palm Court at The Langham</a>, London W1<strong>. </strong></p>
<h2>Naomi on John</h2> <p><strong>First impressions?</strong> Genial, portly, with an impressive shock of silver hair, which I couldn't help noting could have been more flatteringly styled. Hope I didn't offend by actually mentioning this later on.</p> <p><strong>What did you talk about? </strong>The conversation did not flag for a full three hours. <br/></p> <p><strong>Any awkward moments? </strong>No. <br/></p> <p><strong>Good table manners? </strong>Impeccable.</p> <p><strong>Best thing about him? </strong>Good-humoured, pleasantly self-deprecating and generous, ferreting in his wallet for an extra tip when I found I'd shelled out nearly all my change at the station car park.</p> <p><strong>Did you go on somewhere?</strong> Yes, all the way to the station.</p> <p><strong>Marks out of 10? </strong>A congenial date but I wouldn't see us sustaining a full-on relationship: 6.5.</p> <p><strong>Would you meet again? </strong>A very nice man, but not likely to become an addition to my circle of friends.</p> <h2>John on Naomi</h2> <p><strong>First impressions?</strong> I knew it wasn't to be love at first sight. We look so wildly different. She looked like a radical intellectual "bluestocking", which I admire. I don't think either of us wanted to jump the other's bones, though… which is OK.</p> <p><strong>What did you talk about?</strong> Our histories, house prices and the areas we lived in, sexuality, education, how impressive the loos were, feminist linguistics.</p> <p><strong>Any awkward moments? </strong>Not one.</p> <p><strong>Good table manners?</strong> Neither of us spilled our food on our clothes, which for me was an achievement.</p> <p><strong>Best thing about her? </strong>Her drive to make the world a better place – great to see the spirit of '68 still alive.</p> <p><strong>Did you go on somewhere? </strong>I walked her to the station. I think both of us realised it wasn't a magical "hit by lightning" thing.</p> <p><strong>Marks out of 10?</strong> 10!</p> <p><strong>Would you meet again?</strong> Not as a romantic item, no.</p> <p>• John and Naomi ate at <a href="http://www.sanctumsoho.com" title="">Sanctum Soho</a>, London W1.

<h2>Ian on Jane</h2> <p><strong>First impressions</strong> Attractive, friendly and relaxed. Her outfit was really nice but as I'm a scruffy git, I felt a bit paranoid I wasn't in her league, sartorially. Or financially.</p> <p><strong>What did you talk about? </strong>All sorts of stuff, and the Unicorn vegan grocery in Chorlton. Awesome place but we've both guiltily had steaks at the bottom of our shopping bags while there. </p> <p><strong>Any awkward moments? </strong>Not as far as I could tell.</p> <p><strong>Good table manners? </strong>Impeccable.</p> <p><strong>Best thing about her? </strong>Cute smile.</p> <p><strong>Did you go on somewhere? </strong>For a pint.</p> <p><strong>Marks out of 10? </strong>7.</p> <p><strong>Would you meet again? </strong>I would but she lives in the Wirral, so it's unlikely to happen that often.</p> <h2>Jane on Ian</h2> <p><strong>First impressions </strong>Tall, dark, nice looking and cheery.</p> <p><strong>What did you talk about? </strong>Lots! Travel, the city, politics, growing up/not growing up, India, carbon footprints, what on earth made us decide to volunteer for the blind date column ...</p> <p><strong>Any awkward moments? </strong>No.</p> <p><strong>Good table manners? </strong>Yes, and good with chopsticks.</p> <p><strong>Best thing about him? </strong>Plenty of great stories, drive, and creative.</p> <p><strong>Did you go on somewhere?</strong> Yes, for last orders.</p> <p><strong>Marks out of 10 </strong>8.</p> <p><strong>Would you meet again? </strong>Yes, we are in touch. </p> <p>• Ian and Jane ate at Yang Sing, 34 Princes Street, Manchester, 0161-236 2200.</p>
