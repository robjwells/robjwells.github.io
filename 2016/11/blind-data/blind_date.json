Fortunately for us, almost 600 Guardian readers have been brave enough to do exactly that. Since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/31/blind-date\" title=\"\">Blind Date began in 2009</a>, we&apos;ve set up nearly 300 couples, and the details of their encounters \u2013 the good, the bad and the downright bizarre \u2013 have become one of Weekend magazine&apos;s best\u2011loved features. Here, we sum up the state of play in the era of online dating and apps such as Tinder, and you can also catch up with some of our favourite Blind Date couples and find out whether love was in the air. Did Sam and Emily survive the pornstar martini incident? Were Lou and David meant for one another? And what next for the Blind Date wedding couples?</p> <h2>How we date now<br /></h2> <p>For the first time since records began, more of us are single than not. In England and Wales, the 2011 census revealed that 51% of us are not married (up from 47% in 2001). In Scotland 35% of adults are single, an increase of 5% in the 10 years to 2011, while Northern Ireland saw a 20% increase in the number of single people. Statistics don&apos;t reveal the full picture, of course \u2013 how many of us are technically single but still have a significant other? \u2013 but they help to illustrate why dating services have become such big business.</p> <p>The way we look for love is changing. Online dating, once considered the preserve of only the truly lonely, is now so commonplace that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/mar/15/uk-shopping-basket-updated\" title=\"\">Office for National Statistics added it to the basket of goods and services it uses to calculate inflation</a>. Three in 10 of us still ask our friends to set us up, say analysts Mintel, but that&apos;s matched by the three in 10 who use free dating sites to find a partner. &quot;We&apos;re being reared on the notion of our own individuality and the belief that we need tools and filters to find other like-minded individuals, rather than put our faith in supposedly hokey old adages like &apos;opposites\u00a0attract&apos;,&quot; says Mintel&apos;s Richard Cope.</p> <p>As we become more businesslike about shopping for love, the list of what we look for in a partner gets longer. &quot;We&apos;re not just looking for a romantic partner, we&apos;re looking for a friend, confidant, sexual partner, co-parent, sometimes even a business partner,&quot; says relationship counsellor <a href=\"http://www.valsampson.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Val Sampson</a>. As our expectations grow, dating sites offer increasingly sophisticated packages to help us meet our perfect match. <a href=\"https://www.zoosk.com/\" title=\"\">Zoosk</a>, for example, offers &quot;behavioural matchmaking&quot;: rather than use detailed personality questionnaires, it analyses how you interact with the site to predict your best matches. So, although you might say you&apos;re interested in intellectual types, if you tend to linger over the profiles of honed gym bunnies, Zoosk might steer you in that direction.</p> <p><strong>The rise of niche dating </strong><br />At the other end of the scale, niche dating is becoming increasingly popular, thanks to the availability of website software that makes it easier for individuals to maintain a site. Some companies run multiple niche-dating sites, for groups ranging from Star Trekkers to fans of the mullet hairstyle. If you&apos;re yearning to meet a fellow Twilight enthusiast, then you could try Vampire Passions. Vegetarians might prefer the gentler souls over at Veggie Romance. Or, if you&apos;re fed up with discovering your date is not quite as advertised in their profile picture, you may prefer the refreshingly honest approach of the Ugly Bug Ball dating site, which boasts the tagline &quot;dating for the\u00a0aesthetically average&quot;.</p> <p><strong>What&apos;s the alternative?</strong> <br />Despite online dating&apos;s seemingly unstoppable rise, transparency is still a problem. How do you know whether the people you&apos;re talking to are genuine? &quot;Research shows that minor lying is prevalent on dating sites, with a typical person claiming to be an inch taller, five pounds lighter and a year or two younger,&quot; writes economist Paul Oyer in his book Everything I Ever Needed To Know About Economics I Learned From Online Dating. An\u00a0analysis of users of OKCupid, one of America&apos;s largest dating sites, revealed that an inexplicable number of men claimed to be exactly 6ft tall, and there were about four times as many people claiming to earn $100,000 a year as there should have been, if they were anything like the average population.</p> <p>If you prefer the thought of a real-life hook-up, where your date can&apos;t hide behind a 10-years-younger profile pic, then there&apos;s also a growing number of events marketed at singles, including the triumphantly grumpy Down With Dating parties, run by the team behind the popular Feeling Gloomy club nights (feelinggloomy.com/Down_With_Dating). Or you could try pheromone parties, the latest fad from (wouldn&apos;t you know it) Los Angeles. Sleep in the same T-shirt for three nights, bag it, then take it with you to the event and let strangers sniff it. The theory is we&apos;re attracted to people with compatible pheromones. In the unlikely event you sniff out the love of your life, you&apos;ll have a great story to tell the grandchildren. True romantics can try Shhh\u00a0Dating (shhhdating.com) \u2013 speed dating where no talking is allowed during your one-minute encounters. Yes, you engineered it, but you can still claim you knew the first time you looked into each other&apos;s eyes.</p> <h2><strong>Dating at any age</strong><br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-445594477\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/19/1408442603104/Young-couple-drinking-whi-011.jpg\" alt=\"Young couple drinking white wine\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A lack of confidence is an issue for daters in their 20s, but confidence increases in our 30s. Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Is dating at 20 really all that different from dating at 65? The core issue may remain the same \u2013 will you find someone you like who likes you too? \u2013 but, as relationship counsellor Val Sampson points out, &quot;the external pressures, the societal ones, differ quite a lot depending on our age.</p> <p>&quot;If you&apos;re a 32-year-old single woman attending your 15th wedding of the year then you&apos;re in a very different\u00a0place from the man who is 55, newly divorced, and single for the first time in his adult life.&quot;</p> <p><strong>In your 20s:</strong>&quot;We&apos;ve noticed that a lack of confidence is a predominant theme for a lot of daters in their 20s, says psychologist Madeleine Mason, who along with therapist Dan Williams runs\u00a0Passionsmiths.com. &quot;I\u00a0suspect this is due to having less life-experience.&quot;</p> <p>It may sound surprising, that the group we most commonly think of as carefree and single are suffering from a lack of self-esteem, but Sampson thinks it may have a lot to do with how the dating landscape has evolved. &quot;Apps such as Tinder don&apos;t do either sex many favours\u00a0in terms of self-esteem, but I suspect that they make it even harder for men. They&apos;re coming under increasing pressure to look a certain way, and women typically have a lot more access to things that make them look better.&quot;</p> <p>Can you avoid online dating if you&apos;re in your 20s? &quot;I have discovered at my age that there&apos;s not much of a pool of people outside dating sites,&quot; says Miriam Waddimba, 29. &quot;People on the free sites aren&apos;t that serious, so the paid-for sites are better if you&apos;re looking for a relationship.&quot;</p> <p><strong>In your 30s</strong>: The good news is that for most of us, our confidence increases in our thirties, as other parts of our life start to slot into place, but as the average age for marriage is 28 for women, and 30 for men, you may start to feel like the odd one out if you&apos;re still single. &quot;Until recently there was no such thing as singledom as we know it,&quot; writes relationships expert Harville Hendrix in the classic self-help book Getting The Love You Want. &quot;It was merely a bridge between the childhood bed and the marriage bed, to be crossed as quickly and uneventfully as possible.&quot; Little wonder, then, that you&apos;re having to deal with other people&apos;s awkwardness as they work out where to place you.</p> <p>If you haven&apos;t yet found a long-term partner, ignore anyone who tells you you&apos;re too fussy. &quot;There is a media narrative out there that suggests the fault is ours,&quot; says Jessica Massa, co-author of The Gaggle, a book that sprang from the website WTFisupwithmylovelife. Is it really that ludicrous to hold out for someone you&apos;re genuinely attracted to?</p> <p><strong>In your</strong> <strong>40s: </strong>The best way to describe dating in your 40s? Complicated. For a lot of men and women it feels like the last possible moment to start a family, which distorts the criteria you use when looking for\u00a0a partner. &quot;You&apos;re doubling or\u00a0even tripling the pressure,&quot; says Sampson. &quot;But if you try to force the pace of a relationship when neither of you are quite ready, it&apos;s a bit like trying to drive a car with the handbrake on.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I remember feeling quite quickly that we were at very different points in our lives,&quot; says <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/17/blind-date-jenny-morgan-joel-baillie-lane\" title=\"\">Jenny Morgan, who went on a blind date with Joel in 2012</a>. This is common for forty- and fiftysomething daters, who may be long\u2011term singles or newly divorced and back on the scene for the first time in decades. &quot;I&apos;ve noticed that for quite a lot of people in this age group, they&apos;re working through a lot of regret about previous relationships,&quot; says Mason. &quot;There&apos;s often a greater awareness of how their behaviour played a part.&quot;</p> <p><strong>In your 50s:</strong> It&apos;s more than likely that other people are complicating your quest for a new relationship, particularly if you have grown-up children. &quot;Children can be very traditional when it comes to their parents,&quot; observes Sampson. &quot;A newly single woman in her 50s may feel fantastically liberated, but it&apos;s not the role society would have placed her in. And can you be dating when your daughter, who is in her 20s, isn&apos;t? That&apos;s a whole new dynamic that a lot of parents and children are negotiating.&quot;</p> <p>Men may not encounter the same degree of opposition but they may feel that the rules of dating have become more complicated. &quot;The rules around what constitutes gentlemanly behaviour are trickier, and I think a lot of men wonder about what role their partner wants them to play,&quot; says Sampson.</p> <p><strong>In your 60s: </strong>Take a lesson from your younger compatriots on the frontline of dating and embrace the internet. &quot;It&apos;s a real boon for people in this age bracket that they no longer have to rely on the benevolence of married friends for a date,&quot; says Sampson. And remember you&apos;re never too old to use a condom. Figures published in the British Medical Journal show that STDs in this age group have doubled in a decade.</p> <h2>The science of love<br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-445594478\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/19/1408444363040/A-Church-of-Scotland-kirk-009.jpg\" alt=\"A Church of Scotland kirk\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sharing the same religion and having similar attitudes to children, money and politics increase the chances of dating success. Photograph: Simon Price/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Your first date. No doubt you&apos;ve already made a number of decisions that have led you to this moment \u2013 you&apos;ve said yes to going out with them, so on some level, you&apos;ve made a judgement about whether you might be a good match. Perhaps you used a dating website that boasts a complicated algorithm to pick potential partners. You&apos;ve selected a venue, or your date has, factoring in a number of variables (will there be candlelight, seclusion, are you likely to be rushed by the waiters?) You&apos;ve chosen an outfit, no doubt giving some thought to what your clothes say about you. Will you be a fashionable five minutes late? Have you got your small talk prepared? Have you considered who will pay the bill?</p> <p>If you believe the research, then the decisions you make \u2013 even the little ones \u2013 all have the potential to increase your chances of getting a second date. Some of the larger dating sites pride themselves on their scientific approach to matchmaking. eHarmony funds a research lab in California, where research includes a longitudinal study of the factors that influence marital success. Chemistry.com (a division of Match.com) employs scientific advisers, including the anthropologist Helen Fisher. It seems it&apos;s no longer enough to rely on the possibility that you and your date will just &quot;click&quot;. You&apos;ve got to trust in the science of attraction.</p> <p>But what do we really know about creating chemistry between two people? &quot;There are definitely consistent patterns in the research,&quot; says Christian Jarrett, a neuroscientist and the author of The Rough Guide To Psychology. &quot;For example, the evidence seems pretty overwhelming that despite the adage &apos;opposites attract&apos;, most of us are actually more attracted to people similar to ourselves.&quot;</p> <p>Many studies suggest we&apos;ve got a greater chance of success if we choose a partner with the same religion, who lives close to us, with roughly the same attitude to money, bringing up children and politics. Then there are the physical factors that influence attractiveness \u2013 we tend to select a partner who we judge to be as good-looking as we see ourselves.</p> <p>Beyond that, it all gets a little silly \u2013 and sexist. Researchers at the University of Westminster found that when men were hungry, they were more likely to be attracted to women with higher BMIs. A separate study revealed that women consistently rated the same man more attractive when he was pictured behind the wheel of a Bentley convertible, rather than a Ford Fiesta.</p> <p>No doubt you&apos;ve heard that wearing red is meant to signal sexual availability, but did you know that having a facial scar can enhance a man&apos;s attractiveness? Oh, and researchers in Texas believe that &quot;a positive correlation of function-word [personal pronouns, articles and conjunctions] similarity&quot; signals the likelihood of a good match. &quot;One of the quirkiest studies I came across looked at the influence of diet on the attractiveness of men&apos;s odour,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;The findings suggested that women preferred the smell of men who ate a non\u2011meat diet.&quot;</p> <p>Alligator wrestling, or swimming with sharks, probably aren&apos;t the best ideas for a first date, but apparently people tend to find high-risk behaviours more attractive. However, this only applies when the activities remind us of our hunter-gatherer ancestry. So driving without a seatbelt or not bothering to update antivirus software doesn&apos;t count.</p> <p>This is all great trivia, but unlikely to have much bearing on your real experiences of dating (unless you&apos;re going on some very unusual dates). It&apos;s also worth remembering that studies such as the ones above are, more often than not, based on a sample of volunteer students in the psychology department. &quot;A lot of the research in this area is also grounded in evolutionary psychology so it tends to be about heterosexual attraction,&quot; Jarrett points out. &quot;We actually know very little about the psychology of gay dating, attraction and relationships. Some of the principles identified in heterosexual research may carry across, but until more research is done we won&apos;t know for sure.&quot;</p> <p>But what about the more established &quot;facts&quot; about dating \u2013 the ones we&apos;ve all heard of (make lots of eye contact, laugh at their jokes)? Are they worth paying attention to? &quot;Part of the problem with implementing many of these research findings is that they can backfire when we think too much about them,&quot; says Jarrett. &quot;For example, if you laugh at a person&apos;s jokes, subtly mimic their body language and speech and make appropriate tactile contact (such as a light touch on the arm), the research suggests this will increase your attractiveness. But crucially, this is when you perform these behaviours in a natural way without too much conscious effort. Once you start deliberately mimicking the other person, forcing your laughter, and carefully planning an arm touch, the chances are that you&apos;ll end up seeming odd.&quot;</p> <p>So, perhaps not then. But still, there&apos;s something very seductive about the idea that we may be able to change our fate with the right choice of outfit or a well-timed joke. And then if it all goes wrong, we can blame the experts, rather than ourselves.</p> <h2>What have we learned?<br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-445594479\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/19/1408446321139/A-waiter-and-waitress-013.jpg\" alt=\"A waiter and waitress\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beware the waiter or waitress \u2013 they may be your competition. Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So, nearly 300 dates later, what can we glean from the experiences of the Guardian&apos;s Blind Daters?</p> <p><strong>Avoid shellfish. </strong>Not one, not two, but three dates were derailed by bits of flying lobster, so it&apos;s best to play safe and avoid altogether. (If we sent you to a seafood restaurant, we&apos;re very sorry.) And if your date has just told you she&apos;s allergic to shellfish, it&apos;s probably best not to order the prawns and the crab, Archie.</p> <p><strong>\u2026 And politics.</strong> You might think you&apos;re on safe ground with a fellow Guardian reader, but you&apos;d be wrong. &quot;Bringing up the Olympics was a mistake,&quot; said Darren, ruefully. &quot;Let&apos;s just say we differ on whether Alastair Campbell has explaining to do to the families of dead Iraqis,&quot; was Peyvand&apos;s conclusion after his date with Dawn. &quot;Film, theatre, books, food, music are the best, stress-free ways to have a conversation with someone new and discover if you like them,&quot; says Max Goldman, who went on a date with Reuben Kaye in 2013. &quot;Generally I stay away from previous relationships and politics but perhaps I&apos;m too old fashioned.&quot;</p> <p><strong>So what can you talk about?</strong> &quot;We talked about childbirth,&quot; said David, of his date with Amy in 2014. &quot;Which was a little surreal.&quot; Name a topic and it&apos;s likely our Blind Daters have covered it, from pandas to &quot;Neighbours [the TV show], and how we could start a communist party&quot; (we&apos;re not sure if the two were connected), &quot;ant civilisations&quot; and, unfortunately for Chris&apos;s date, &quot;mostly Chris&quot;. Perhaps just remember to ask your date one or two polite questions, rather than launch into a monologue about your childhood.</p> <p><strong>A cup of tea is a euphemism </strong>for &quot;I do not want to see this person again, but I am too polite to say so.&quot; Blind Daters, we&apos;re on to you.</p> <p><strong>Think about your compliments.</strong> &quot;I said she looked like my sister. Followed by &apos;don&apos;t worry, I love my sister&apos;,&quot; said Andrew. Unsurprisingly, Catherine wasn&apos;t all that sure she wanted to see him again.</p> <p><strong>Serving staff are the enemy. </strong>Not really, your waiter or waitress is probably very nice but you may be in competition with them for your date&apos;s affections. &quot;Our waitress kept flirting with us both, a lot, but we grew to really like it,&quot; said David and Peter. Any regrets, Jessica? &quot;It would have been nice if the hot waiter had joined us for a drink.&quot;</p> <p><strong>Your date is not the enemy.</strong> Although you wouldn&apos;t know it from some of our Blind Dates. Others, though, have a better philosophy. &quot;I used to be a police officer, and it taught me that no matter what situation someone&apos;s in, just talk to them like they&apos;re a person,&quot; says Oliver Nguyen, a Blind Dater from 2010. &quot;Be as respectful and nice as possible, and chat like they&apos;re a friend.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Before I did Blind Date, I was so terrified of the whole &apos;What do you say to a stranger&apos; question,&quot; says Anand Modha. &quot;But then I realised, the chances are you&apos;ve met through the same forum, so in a sense you&apos;re coming from the same place. That made the whole thing easier.&quot;</p> <p><strong>Be single.</strong> It should really go without saying \u2013 however, more than one of our Blind Daters appeared to be suspiciously attached.

Married: July 2014</p> <p><strong><em>Olivia on James</em></strong><br /><strong>First impressions?</strong> Smart, polite, friendly smile. I thought, &quot;Great, I&apos;ll be in good company this evening!&quot;</p> <p><strong>What did you talk about?</strong> Early ambitions to work in the arts, old cinemas and pubs, home ownership, Eddie Izzard&apos;s theory on cat psychology, analysing Harry Potter; plus sailing stories and how Jaws has traumatised us both for life. We had a lot in common.</p> <p><strong>Any awkward moments?</strong> We did think it funny that we were so well attended by all the restaurant staff.</p> <p><strong>Good table manners?</strong> Flawless.</p> <p><strong>Best thing about him?</strong> He is passionate about his interests, and he&apos;s hilarious and a gentleman.</p> <p><strong>Did you go on somewhere?</strong> No, we were having such a good time it was closing time before we knew it.</p> <p><strong>Marks out of 10?</strong> I can&apos;t think of anything that would lose him a point.</p> <p><strong>Would you meet again?</strong> We exchanged numbers, so we&apos;ll see!</p> <p><strong><em>James on Olivia</em></strong><br /><strong>First impressions?</strong> Strikingly pretty. I\u00a0arrived early, but she was already there. She looked great, and the restaurant lighting made the scene look like a Vettriano\u00a0painting.</p> <p><strong>What did you talk about?</strong> Cubism, Aperol, sailing, synaesthesia, Yorkshire, Venice, Harry Potter, marathon training, Glasgow, siblings, sleeper trains, bleak landscapes, basking sharks.</p> <p><strong>Any awkward moments?</strong> Not that I remember.</p> <p><strong>Good table manners?</strong> Impeccable.</p> <p><strong>Best thing about her?</strong> We talked nonstop \u2013 one of the most enjoyable conversations I&apos;ve\u00a0had.</p> <p><strong>Did you go on somewhere?</strong> No. We left after everyone had gone and the restaurant started to close at 12.30.</p> <p><strong>Marks out of 10?</strong> 9.</p> <p><strong>Would you meet again?</strong> We are going for drinks soon.</p> <h2>What happened next</h2> <p><strong>Olivia:</strong> We got married at the beginning of July, in Scotland. Yes, we had a ceilidh! I wasn&apos;t sure if I was going to give a speech, and didn&apos;t in the end, because the time ran out, but I really wanted to read out my original answer to the Blind Date questionnaire about what the best thing was about James, because it&apos;s still true. Amazingly, the best man quoted it in his speech.</p> <p>I was in Argentina when it came out and I though &quot;argh, how cringey&quot;, but then we realised we&apos;d both felt the same thing. I\u00a0think having to report back made us both more honest about our feelings, because you don&apos;t normally say those sort of things after one date, do you?</p> <p><strong>James:</strong> I remember filling in the questionnaire after the date and while I was writing it I started reliving the date and realised just how much I&apos;d enjoyed it. It was great at the wedding to be able to thank our friends Helen and Caz, who persuaded us to sign up for Blind Date in the first place.</p> <h2>Music teacher Stef Stewart-Hodges, 24 and web\u00a0developer\u00a0Graham Lyons, 29</h2> <p>The date: December 2009. Married: December 2013</p> <p><strong><em>Stef on Graham</em></strong><br /><strong>First impressions?</strong> Friendly, funny, attractive. And forgiving: I was late.</p> <p><strong>What did you talk about?</strong> Music, comedy, food, bad\u00a0dancing.</p> <p><strong>Any awkward moments?</strong> Only when we were playing pool \u2013 neither of us are fabulous players.</p> <p><strong>Good table manners?</strong> Impeccable, even though\u00a0it was burgers. He\u00a0faced the ultimate date challenge well.</p> <p><strong>Best thing about him?</strong> Really genuine and friendly.</p> <p><strong>Did you go on somewhere?</strong> No, but then we didn&apos;t leave till\u00a02am.</p> <p><strong>Marks out of 10?</strong> 9 (being a teacher, I can never give full marks).</p> <p><strong>Would you meet again?</strong> I&apos;d really like to, yeah.</p> <p><strong><em>Graham on Stef</em></strong><br /><strong>First impressions?</strong> Effortlessly beautiful and unforgivably late. But she had phoned.</p> <p><strong>What did you talk about?</strong> Music, cooking and why Abba are the greatest pop band ever.</p> <p><strong>Any awkward moments?</strong> Not really.</p> <p><strong>Good table manners?</strong> I&apos;ve never seen a burger crammed into a face with such grace and finesse.</p> <p><strong>Best thing about her?</strong> Anyone who knows the\u00a0full routine to Saturday Night Fever and\u00a0is prepared to strut their stuff scores highly with me.</p> <p><strong>Did you go on somewhere?</strong> Cash machine, bus stop.</p> <p><strong>Marks out of 10?</strong> 9. Would have been higher but I lost a game of pool.</p> <p><strong>Would you meet again?</strong> Yes, it&apos;d be great to do it again.</p> <h2>What happened next</h2> <p><strong>Graham: </strong>We were quite disappointed because a year or two after we were in the paper we saw that you sent a couple to LA. We only got to go to Earl&apos;s Court. What&apos;s that about?</p> <p>We got married on 20 December last year, in a Georgian townhouse in London. It was gorgeous. There was a former Guardian staffer there, Anna, who set us up. If she hadn&apos;t picked us, totally at random, then there wouldn&apos;t have been a wedding\u2026</p> <p><strong>Stef:</strong> ... and there wouldn&apos;t be a baby. We know we&apos;re having a boy, he&apos;s due in\u00a0October. Everyone keeps saying it&apos;s a honeymoon baby, but it isn&apos;t, I promise. We can&apos;t decide on names, so maybe you could run a competition? Let&apos;s ask Guardian readers to choose.

Here&apos;s what they said back then in a post-date interview \u2013 followed by their accounts of what happened next.</p> <p><strong><em>Edwina on David</em></strong><br /><strong>Before the date, what were you hoping for? </strong>Dave Grohl. I mean, I knew he was a musician and called Dave.</p> <p><strong>First impressions? </strong>There must be some mistake here. But I went with it.</p> <p><strong>What did you talk about? </strong>He told me session guitarist horror stories. Skinny-dipping in parks. Dates we&apos;d been on. Think he got on to juggling babies\u2026</p> <p><strong>Any awkward moments? </strong>No. But maybe I thought he was nuts when he sat on the bar stool later, with a scarf around his legs.</p> <p><strong>Good table manners? </strong>He didn&apos;t check his phone, fart, turn up drunk or talk all about himself, so yes.</p> <p><strong>Best thing about him? </strong>Good eyebrows.</p> <p><strong>Would you introduce him to your friends? </strong>Yes. I seemed to meet all of his at the bar after.</p> <p><strong>Could he meet the parents? </strong>He&apos;d be skinned alive.</p> <p><strong>Did you go on somewhere? </strong>Yep, Ronnie Scott&apos;s for jazz. He knew everybody in the room.</p> <p><strong>And\u2026 did you kiss? </strong>No chemistry. And he didn&apos;t ask nicely.</p> <p><strong>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? </strong>To have cut out the starting-off-as-strangers chitchat.</p> <p><strong>Marks out of 10? </strong>10. Girls, this man is single.</p> <p><strong>Would you meet again? </strong>Not for a date but out with friends, yes.</p> <p><strong><em>David on Edwina</em></strong><br /><strong>Before the date, what were you hoping for? </strong>No expectations; let anything happen and just go with it.</p> <p><strong>First impressions? </strong>Smiley, friendly, easy to talk to.</p> <p><strong>What did you talk about? </strong>Careers, banana hair, jazz, film, circus hoops, illegal swimming, Old Vic tunnels.</p> <p><strong>Any awkward moments? </strong>A joke I made about juggling babies upside down while dressed as a transvestite and listening to a Hitler speech. Luckily she laughed.</p> <p><strong>Good table manners? </strong>An elegant sufficiency.</p> <p><strong>Best thing about her? </strong>Good sense of humour, easy to talk and listen to.</p> <p><strong>Would you introduce her to your friends? </strong>I\u00a0did \u2013 a few too many, considering.</p> <p><strong>Could she meet the parents? </strong>At her own peril.</p> <p><strong>Did you go on somewhere? </strong>To Ronnie Scott&apos;s till 2am.</p> <p><strong>And\u2026 did you kiss? </strong>Cheek to cheek.</p> <p><strong>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? </strong>The night before I took a weird American sleeping pill that turned me into a zombie.</p> <p><strong>Marks out of 10? </strong>Do I have to? It&apos;s not Best In Show.</p> <p><strong>Would you meet again? </strong>Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps\u2026 but probably not.</p> <h2>What happened next...<br /></h2> <p><strong>Edwina:</strong> On the night itself, we stayed out in Soho. I\u00a0seem to remember we fell off some bar stools about 5am, and decided to leave it at that. It was a great night but I think we&apos;d done enough damage to each other by that point. I didn&apos;t do it to meet the love of my life, just to have a bit of fun, and it was, so, thanks!</p> <p>I&apos;m in a relationship now. My boyfriend jokes that it was a bit of a shock Googling me for the first time and finding out about my love life from the national papers, but he doesn&apos;t mind really.</p> <p><strong>David:</strong> After I sent the initial email in to Blind Date, I didn&apos;t expect to hear back at all, so it was a bit of a surprise when they got in touch. The date itself was fine, it was interesting getting to know a complete stranger. I remember it was just after Shrove Tuesday and she mentioned her dad was a priest. I&apos;m not religious myself, and although I don&apos;t really like to generalise, I think it hampered things a bit, maybe. We sent each other a text the next day, and decided we wouldn&apos;t give each other a bad write up but after that, there was nothing. It was a fun thing to do though. I always like surprises.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-445298696\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/7/4/1341405642213/Blind-date-7-July-2012-008.jpg\" alt=\"Blind date 7 July 2012\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emily and Sam: 'He was forced to kiss the cabaret singer.'

He was smiley and relaxed, which put me at ease.</p> <p><strong>What did you talk about? </strong>Dubious homemade cocktails, afternoon tea, gingerbread, magic tricks.</p> <p><strong>Any awkward moments? </strong>Erm, you mean apart from when the large man in a tutu told me not to look desperate? Or when Sam was forced to kiss the cabaret singer? There was also an unfortunate incident with a pornstar martini.

A very pleasant evening.</p> <p><strong>Would you meet again? </strong>We&apos;ve discussed meeting for a nice cup of tea.</p> <h2>What happened next...</h2> <p><strong>Emily: </strong>We didn&apos;t see each other after our date. We texted once the date had been in the paper, mainly to share the horror. I found out that a lot of my parents&apos; friends read the Guardian.</p> <p>I think both of us did a good job of covering up how embarrassing it had been. We had been sent to a burlesque club, and let&apos;s just say there were a lot of awkward moments. Like when Sam spilt his drink \u2013 it was bright orange, he was wearing a pale top and there wasn&apos;t a drop left in the glass. We agreed before we left what we&apos;d share, because we thought no one would believe us if we revealed everything. It wasn&apos;t the best situation, so who knows what would have happened if we&apos;d both felt a bit more comfortable.</p> <p><strong>Sam: </strong>We messaged when the piece went in the paper (both somewhat relieved), but didn&apos;t meet again. I&apos;d definitely do another blind date though. It was very refreshing to meet someone with no preconceptions, but I&apos;d be careful not to spill an entire pornstar martini all\u00a0down me.</p> <p>I&apos;m still single, in fact.

But it was interesting while it lasted, which wasn&apos;t very long, and it was a positive experience. Since then, I\u00a0have met someone.</p> <p><strong>Lou:</strong> As I left the date I felt we would see each other again. After a few days, I received what seemed to me like a slightly odd text. I knew it was from David but I couldn&apos;t decipher what the message was trying to say. All I really thought was needed was a simple &quot;Would you like to go out again?&quot; Anyway, I didn&apos;t reply as I hoped he would try again with a less convoluted approach, but I heard nothing and took that to mean he probably wasn&apos;t that interested.</p> <p>I&apos;m currently single but am dating and keeping my eye open for Mr Right. I would definitely do it again.

This is how James Reeves recorded his first impressions of Olivia Rickman on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2011/jan/08/blind-date\" title=\"\">8\u00a0January 2011, in Weekend magazine</a>: &quot;Strikingly pretty. I\u00a0arrived early, but she was already there. She looked great, and the restaurant lighting made the scene look like a <a href=\"http://www.jackvettriano.com/\" title=\"\">Vettriano</a> painting.&quot; It wasn&apos;t simply what she looked like, though. They talked about: &quot;Cubism, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperol\" title=\"\">Aperol</a>, sailing, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/nov/19/synaesthesia-cross-overs-senses\" title=\"\">synaesthesia</a>, the size of Yorkshire\u2026,&quot; said James at the time. And he&apos;d barely begun. &quot;\u2026Venice, Harry Potter, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggy_Guggenheim\" title=\"\">Peggy Guggenheim</a>, marathon training, Glasgow, siblings, sleeper trains, bleak landscapes, the attentiveness of the staff, basking sharks.&quot; Olivia&apos;s account was less florid, but equally glowing. Marks out of 10? &quot;I\u00a0can&apos;t think of anything that would lose him a\u00a0point.&quot;</p> <p>That blind date happened in December 2010. Two years later, just before Christmas, Weekend received an email from James: &quot;Olivia and I are getting married.&quot; He thanked us profusely, and the next day cycled in with a box of chocolates.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/video/2013/feb/08/guardian-weekend-blind-date-couples-video\">It was our first Blind Date wedding. After three years and 11 months, and 200-plus dates, we&apos;d finally pulled it off</a>.</p> <p>A week later we got a call from another pair of Blind Daters: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/dec/19/blind-date\" title=\"\">Stefanie Stewart-Hodges and Graham Lyons</a>. They were also getting married. This was becoming dangerously like a habit. But, once again, the signs were there from the start. &quot;Effortlessly beautiful,&quot; said Graham in December 2009. Would Stefanie like to see him again? &quot;I&apos;d really like to, yeah.&quot;</p> <p>Both couples say they are gradualists. No need to hurry: they&apos;ll marry in the fullness of time. But Weekend is not so restrained. So we rush them into a studio to mock up the big day. Olivia is changing into her wedding dress by the time I\u00a0arrive, and James is suited and booted. When she emerges fully dressed, he looks at her adoringly. He doesn&apos;t quite seem to believe his luck.</p> <p>It&apos;s four years since Weekend started the Blind Date column. Anna Chesters, who sets up the encounters, says she looks for three things: age, location and common interests. If two people do the same job, she rules them out \u2013 too much of a busman&apos;s holiday. In the early days, people used to send in pictures. Now she asks them not to, although very occasionally Blind Daters have complained that their partners do not match them in the looks department. Women applicants outweigh men by 20 to one. &quot;They&apos;re generally more willing to have fun,&quot; Anna says, &quot;and more confident about it. The men tend to be nervous.&quot;</p> <p>The dates don&apos;t always go well. First impressions have ranged from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/oct/26/blind-date-james-alice\" title=\"\">&quot;Too damned tall&quot;</a> to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/jun/15/blind-date-edward-ellie\" title=\"\">&quot;25 minutes late and didn&apos;t really apologise&quot;</a> and, most uncompromisingly, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/nov/09/blind-date-maddy-barney\" title=\"\">&quot;That&apos;s not Anne Hathaway&quot;</a>. Any awkward moments? <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/21/blind-date\" title=\"\">&quot;He took my photo and uploaded it on Instagram.&quot;</a> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/jun/15/blind-date-edward-ellie\" title=\"\">&quot;I&apos;d run out of things to say, so we walked to the tube in silence.&quot;</a> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/may/11/blind-date-emily-luke\" title=\"\">&quot;He\u00a0asked if I owned a corset within 10 minutes... I\u00a0didn&apos;t know what to say when he suggested we\u00a0&apos;call a spade a spade and leave it at tonight&apos;.&quot;</a></p> <p>There&apos;s something painfully personal about Blind Date: the bottom line is, it could be me \u2013 or you. When daters hate each other, we wince. When they are nice about each other but then give low marks, we feel cheated. When they are vile about each other but give high marks, we feel confused. When they complain about their partners being too short or too tall, or say they wish they&apos;d been stuck in traffic, or a woman moans that the man didn&apos;t pay for her taxi home, readers email to rail against heightism, bitchiness and sexism. Sometimes daters go the other way: they&apos;re too polite, they agree to give each other the same scores and consult on comments. And, on rare occasions, they adore each other.</p> <p>Any blind date is scary, but throw in an appearance in a national newspaper, a warts&apos;n&apos;all photoshoot, a series of embarrassing questions (table manners, awkward moments, did you kiss?) and a scorecard, and you wonder why anybody would do it. What&apos;s in it for them besides a free meal? And what&apos;s the chance of finding true love on a date set up by a stranger? Actually, we can answer the last question \u2013 if marriage is the ultimate measure, we have a 1% success rate (two\u00a0engagements from 200-odd encounters).</p> <p>The funny thing, Olivia says, is she wasn&apos;t really looking for a relationship. She signed up to Blind Date for a laugh and, hopefully, a nice evening out. She&apos;d moved from Scotland to London a\u00a0few years earlier to work in PR, and had not had a boyfriend since a long-term relationship at university. &quot;London is a tough place\u2026 there are almost too many people. Young professionals are so busy trying to get work sorted, some money together, get\u00a0themselves settled.&quot; She was only 29, but she&apos;d given up on love. &quot;I thought, &apos;It doesn&apos;t matter, I&apos;m happy; other things in life are going really well.&apos;&quot;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-403774715\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/2/6/1360155616921/Olivia-Rickman-and-James--008.jpg\" alt=\"Olivia Rickman and James Reeves\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Olivia wears silk dress, \u00a31,815, VWDC by <a href=\"http://www.charliebrear.com\">charliebrear.com</a>. Photograph: Jay Brooks</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>&quot;Which is almost a realisation you have to come to if you&apos;re going to be calm and happy when you go into dates, rather than nervous and gibbering,&quot; James adds. Having said that, he gibbered for all he was worth when he first saw her. &quot;I remember swearing under my breath, &apos;<em>Bloody</em> hell!&apos;&quot;</p> <p>Did she clock his reaction? &quot;No,&quot; Olivia says. &quot;Not at all. He was very calm and collected. Very smooth. I just thought he looked really friendly.&quot;</p> <p>James, who was 30 at the time, had just bought his first house, was getting on with his career as a\u00a0chartered surveyor, and finding Ms Right simply wasn&apos;t a priority. &quot;I had been single for about a\u00a0year. But I was busy doing up my house and it was a long commute. It&apos;s a silly excuse, but I had been busy.&quot;</p> <p>They talked and talked. They didn&apos;t kiss. The next day James texted to say he&apos;d had a wonderful time, and suggested they meet again. &quot;A tip to all boys,&quot; Olivia says. &quot;Do what James did: follow up one day after the date, saying nice things. He said I was glowing company. That was really nice.&quot;</p> <p>There was no kiss on the second date, either: &quot;It didn&apos;t seem right, and I&apos;m probably a wimp,&quot; James says. But on the third, &quot;Olivia went in for the kiss. I&apos;d like to say it was because I&apos;m too gentlemanly to force myself upon her, but it might also just be that she was a bit bolder.&quot;</p> <p>So now they were a couple? Ah, no, that was date four, he says, when he reciprocated. It had been snowing: &quot;Suddenly there was almost a foot of snow in Battersea. It was a nightmare to get there, but it was just beautiful to be on a date with your new girl and for there to be this blanket of snow. We walked to a Gypsy jazz bar and eventually I\u00a0plucked up the courage and said, &apos;It looks quite slidy and icy down there, we might not make it. So, in case we don&apos;t, I&apos;m going to kiss you now.&apos;&quot;</p> <p>There is something incredibly romantic about James and Olivia. You could imagine James laying his coat over a puddle for Olivia and composing sonnets for her by night. Olivia sent her Blind Date request in nine months before he did, and he says it is astonishing how Anna waited all that time to match her up with him. (The reality is more prosaic \u2013 there are so many more women than men queueing up for dates.) At one point, he talks about how he loves watching Olivia from across a\u00a0room at a party, observing how hard she works\u00a0to make others feel good about themselves.</p> <p>As a couple, Stef and Graham could not be more different. They spend a lot of their time laughing at each other, taking the piss. Both are dry, and very funny. Like James, Graham looks as if he&apos;s won the lottery, and like Olivia, Stef seems in charge. She says she&apos;s the one who organises everything and he carries the bags.</p> <p>Stef, now 27, a music teacher from London, and Graham, now 30, a web developer from Bury, met at a burger bar. By the time Stef got there, Graham was already on the gin and tonic. He was terrified, he says. He&apos;d not told anybody that he was going on a blind date. In his diary, he just wrote, &quot;Out.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;It was only after, when it had gone well, that I\u00a0confessed to people what I&apos;d been doing.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I could have been really weird,&quot; Stef says.</p> <p>Graham: &quot;She could have been.&quot;</p> <p>Stef: &quot;But I&apos;m not, though.&quot;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-403774716\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/2/6/1360156341978/Stefanie-Stewart-Hodges-a-006.jpg\" alt=\"Stefanie Stewart-Hodges and Graham Lyons\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Effortlessly beautiful\u2019 was Graham's description of Stef after their Blind Date. Photograph: Jay Brooks for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What was his greatest fear? &quot;Having a crap time and finding out you&apos;re rubbish in a national newspaper. If you&apos;re rubbish on a normal blind date, you don&apos;t normally find out.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;But here the person could say that girl&apos;s really weird, and then it&apos;s in a national newspaper,&quot; Stef adds. &quot;I didn&apos;t think about it until I read the previous week&apos;s Blind Date, and they really didn&apos;t like each other and suddenly I&apos;m, &apos;Oh my God, I&apos;m doing that next week. This might not be as funny as I thought it would.&apos;&quot;</p> <p>What were her first impressions of him? &quot;He&apos;s not my type. I don&apos;t normally go for fair hair. He looked very friendly and had a\u00a0nice smile.&quot;</p> <p>What is her normal type? &quot;Dark hair. Unfriendly!&quot; She giggles. &quot;Definitely darker. Rugged. Handsome. Hahaha! I&apos;m only kidding!&quot;</p> <p>&quot;She knows how handsome I am.&quot; Graham smiles. You look a bit like Jamie Oliver, I say.</p> <p>&quot;More like Wallace from <a href=\"http://www.wallaceandgromit.com/\" title=\"\">Wallace &amp; Gromit</a>,&quot; Stef says. &quot;When I started to really like him was when I got to know him, outside of the national press-organised date.&quot;</p> <p>After their burgers, they went drinking, played pool and danced till 2am. Was there any physical contact? &quot;I banged my head on the pool table,&quot; Graham says. &quot;I was bending down to retrieve an errant ball and Stef put her hand on my head.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I don&apos;t remember that\u2026&quot; Stef says.</p> <p>&quot;\u2026 to soothe me.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I think you&apos;re making that up.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;No,&quot; Graham insists, &quot;I distinctly remember you had incredibly cold hands, it was like an ice pack. Brilliant. So there was some physical contact.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;And we kissed on the lips,&quot; Stef adds. &quot;He went in for one. I reciprocated a bit. It was a nice kiss.&quot;</p> <p>Did she think that was her sorted for life?</p> <p>&quot;Nope. I thought he was a very nice guy. He did make me laugh, he was very nice, very kind, and helpful in the kitchen \u2013 as they say in Bridget Jones. Just little things he&apos;d do; he helped me make 120 chocolate truffles one day.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;And I barely ate any of them,&quot; Graham says. &quot;Anybody who knows me will know how restrained that was.&quot;</p> <p>They are having their hair cut side by side, before the shoot, talking to each other through the mirrors. I ask them what their previous is \u2013 did they have successful relationships beforehand? Stef laughs. &quot;Well, obviously not <em>that</em> successful.&quot;</p> <p>Has either of them been married before?</p> <p>Graham: &quot;No.&quot;</p> <p>Stef: &quot;I have, actually.&quot; Silence. The seconds tick by. &quot;No, I haven&apos;t. I&apos;m only joking.&quot;</p> <p>Graham looks a little clammy: &quot;You got me slightly worried then.&quot;</p> <p>She says she never thought of herself as the marrying type; still doesn&apos;t. He looks worried again.</p> <p>&quot;It <em>will</em> happen,&quot; he says. &quot;You&apos;ve agreed.&quot;</p> <p>Three years after their first date, Graham proposed to Stef. They were away with Graham&apos;s family over Christmas, it was midnight and they were opening their stockings. She thought he was joking. &quot;He bought me a single oven glove and a\u00a0bottle of whisky,&quot; she says.</p> <p>&quot;I&apos;d been thinking about it in the weeks leading up to Christmas, and I&apos;d decided that I was going to do it but hadn&apos;t quite decided when or where,&quot; Graham says. &quot;I didn&apos;t want to plan it too much because I thought I&apos;d end up too nervous. I\u00a0thought I&apos;d just wait until the moment was right, and it did feel right then.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I was in my pyjamas. And I had no makeup on,&quot; Stef says. &quot;I was a bit grubby, a bit gross.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;She wasn&apos;t gross at all.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I kept saying, &apos;Are you kidding?&apos; His family have got a lovely dog and I said, &apos;Is the dog going to come running in with a camera on his head to capture the moment when I&apos;m totally humiliated because I said yes but you were kidding?&apos;&quot;</p> <p>Did he think she&apos;d say yes? &quot;I was quietly confident. She&apos;s only human.&quot;</p> <p>James&apos;s proposal to Olivia was somewhat more baroque. &quot;I didn&apos;t want to be like everybody else. We were going to see a matinee at the National Theatre, and I thought, &apos;Why not do it there?&apos;&quot; He\u00a0rang up the theatre and asked if there was a\u00a0private place to propose. &quot;On a whim, I said, &apos;I\u00a0don&apos;t suppose you can get me on to one of the stages?&apos;&quot; Come Sunday lunchtime, Olivia was starving but James insisted on a spontaneous tour of the theatre. He decided that when they got to the stage of the <a href=\"http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/venue/olivier-theatre\" title=\"\">Olivier theatre</a>, he would propose. &quot;I\u00a0got down on my knee, and she very quickly said yes and hugged me. Eventually, when she let me go, I got the ring out of my pocket.&quot;</p> <p>Did either of them ever think they&apos;d meet their husband or wife on a blind date? You&apos;ve got to be joking, Olivia says. They didn&apos;t expect to get married full stop \u2013 James because his parents&apos; divorce put him off the idea, and Olivia because she&apos;d given up on finding someone. Now, James says, he thinks there&apos;s something beautiful about a public declaration of love. They discuss their plans for the future \u2013 the wedding next summer, Blind Date babies to follow hopefully, though they probably won&apos;t think of them in those terms.</p> <p>As for Graham, he says he keeps thinking back to that tiny form they filled in for the blind date. &quot;The terror I was feeling before that first night\u2026&quot; He trails off, and starts again. &quot;But thinking back to that first night, we got on so well, it doesn&apos;t surprise me at all that we&apos;re here today.&quot;</p> <p>As he talks, Stef walks out of the changing room in her wedding dress. His mouth opens, cartoon-like, in wonder. She smiles at him. &quot;You look beautiful,&quot; he whispers. &quot;Will you marry me?&quot;</p> <h2><strong>What they thought back then: Blind date 19 December 2009</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-403774717\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/2/6/1360156904190/Stef-Stewart-Hodges-and-G-006.jpg\" alt=\"Stef Stewart-Hodges and Graham Lyons in 2009\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stef described Graham as 'friendly, funny, attractive'  when they met in 2009</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Stef on Graham</strong></p> <p><strong>First impressions?</strong> Friendly, funny, attractive.

And probably very successfully. He seems like the kind of boy that would go down well with mums.</p> <p><strong>Did you go on somewhere? </strong><br />Yes, and eventually even found somewhere that was actually open on a Sunday night, and was bizarrely having happy hour.</p> <p><strong>And... did you kiss? </strong><br />We\u00a0work in the arts, so of course there was cheek kissing.</p> <p><strong>If you could change one</strong> <strong>thing about the evening, what would it be? </strong><br />I would have eaten only a third of my lemon posset, instead of half.

I knew who he was, but I&apos;m more of a football than a rugby fan. When he rocked up, I thought, &quot;Hang on, I know you from somewhere.&quot; It turned out we&apos;ve got a friend in common, and we were once on a\u00a0night out together. It was really funny \u2013 he actually said to me, &quot;Be\u00a0honest, did I try it on with you?&quot;<br /><strong>First impressions? </strong>Christ, he&apos;s big. He&apos;s huge \u2013 so wide! But in a good way. I got something stuck in my eye the day before and the doctor said I\u00a0had to wear an eye patch, but I took it off when he arrived. So I had one gammy eye. James loved the patch \u2013 he had it on more than I did.<br /><strong>What did you talk about? </strong>Dogs \u2013 we&apos;ve both got them. Him living in Paris. We talked a lot \u2013 the waitress couldn&apos;t get a word in.<br /><strong>Any awkward moments? </strong>Only when\u00a0he asked me if I&apos;d Googled him! I mentioned something I&apos;d read about him online, and there was no\u00a0other way I could have known it. I\u00a0think he secretly liked it though.<br /><strong>Good table manners? </strong>He swore more than I like, but apart from that, impeccable.<br /><strong>Best thing about him? </strong>I laughed a lot. For a big butch sporty guy he&apos;s surprisingly camp at times. He had my handbag on at one point. He won&apos;t mind me saying that, because I was abusing him about it and he was loving it. <br /><strong>Did you go on somewhere? </strong>No, but\u00a0we were there until midnight, and he dropped me off.<br /><strong>Marks out of 10?</strong> 7. If he&apos;d sworn less, I&apos;d have given him more. <br /><strong>Would you meet again?</strong> I&apos;d like to. He&apos;s fit, he made me laugh and it was good banter. We kissed. I think if we were both in the same country for more than five minutes, we&apos;d go out and have a laugh. But he&apos;s off to Australia and I&apos;m off to Singapore.

I had to ask her why she had hair covering one of her eyes. She&apos;d scratched her eyeball at work and was worried I&apos;d\u00a0make fun of her, but I said, &quot;Look, I\u00a0play rugby for a living \u2013 the state of my face. You&apos;re lucky just to have a scratch.&quot; I\u00a0wore the patch later on \u2013 I\u00a0thought I\u00a0looked like a James Bond\u00a0villain.<br /><strong>What did you talk about? </strong>Ex-boyfriends and girlfriends, what we\u00a0did, what she&apos;s achieved \u2013 kayaking the Amazon, which is pretty spectacular. What to do and what not\u00a0to do on a first date. Our dogs. Politics. If anything, we had too much\u00a0to say to each other.<br /><strong>Any awkward moments? </strong>No. I&apos;m one\u00a0of those people who doesn&apos;t allow anything to be too awkward, and she was the perfect dinner companion. We were the last people in the restaurant \u2013 they were laying for breakfast around us.<br /><strong>Good table manners? </strong>Immaculate. She was my perfect girl in some respects, because whatever she ordered, she didn&apos;t finish, so she&apos;d say, &quot;Do you want to eat this?&quot; I ate mine and whatever she didn&apos;t have \u2013 I\u00a0got right through the menu.<br /><strong>Best thing about her? </strong>How engaging she is. She&apos;s a very attractive girl, but she also had so much to say for herself. It was one of the best dates I&apos;ve been on in a long time in that respect.<br /><strong>Did you go on somewhere? </strong>I had training the next day, so I did the gentlemanly thing and dropped her home.

His\u00a0time in the army and as a policeman. He told me about a show he&apos;s got coming on and asked about my show.

She was almost hiding behind the restaurant manager, but when she saw me, she ran over, grabbed my arm and said, &quot;Oh my God, I&apos;m so pleased it&apos;s you!&quot; <br /><strong>What did you talk about?</strong> Who we thought we might be set up with. We were both worried it might be someone much older, who wasn&apos;t much fun. We laughed a lot, maybe too loudly \u2013 some of the other diners were looking at us. I\u00a0told her a story about a male gorilla who took a disliking to me at a zoo, and she told me about this monkey she loves, who wears a cape \u2013 she&apos;s\u00a0going to take me to see him. <br /><strong>Any awkward moments? </strong>Her phone kept going with messages from friends dying to know who she&apos;d been set up with.

She&apos;s an absolute laugh, but she&apos;s also very polite and her manners are fantastic. She was so nice to every staff member, which gets a massive tick in my book. <br /><strong>Best thing about her?</strong> People who are as attractive as she is don&apos;t normally have such a lovely personality. It&apos;s so refreshing to find someone with looks, and who&apos;s so much fun to be with. <br /><strong>Did you go on somewhere?</strong> No, because I had to work in the morning. Did we kiss?

He has been single for five years.</p> <p><strong>Did you recognise him? </strong>We both recognised each other immediately.<br /><strong>First impressions? </strong>He was exactly as I&apos;d imagined him from what I&apos;ve seen on TV. Exactly. Taller, though. It was a little bit stiff, but I loosened up with a glass of champagne.<br /><strong>What did you talk about?</strong>Our respective careers. Obviously we were both in Moscow when we were attacked [during a gay rights march in 2007]. Poor old Peter, he sustained permanent head damage as a consequence of the beating he got. I was knocked about, but not permanently injured. So we talked about that a lot. I was keen to\u00a0talk about the work Peter does, because he was standing as a Green candidate at the last election and was a Labour candidate before that. I&apos;ve never met a bona fide political activist and I like politics, so it was interesting to pick his brains. If we&apos;d both been in a pop band, I think we would have finished talking after the starter and gone home. <br /><strong>Any awkward moments? </strong>No. Although one thing that did surprise me was when we&apos;d been rattling on\u00a0about politics for ages and then\u00a0Peter said, &quot;Let&apos;s stop talking about politics and tell me about your\u00a0career.&quot; I was surprised he\u00a0was\u00a0interested. <br /><strong>Good table manners? </strong>He was very picky about food. Not in a bad way. He was very concerned that things were bred properly. So when he ordered the salmon, he didn&apos;t want anything farmed. He was asking a lot more questions than I would have asked. They could have opened a tin and I would have eaten it! Maybe it&apos;s part of his green credentials. I was very relieved that Peter drank. I instinctively don&apos;t trust people who don&apos;t drink.<br /><strong>Best thing about him? </strong>His compassion. He&apos;s absolutely overloaded with compassion for other people to the point where I\u00a0think he neglects himself. I told him so. He&apos;s going back to Moscow and I\u00a0said,&quot;Why are you going? It&apos;s ridiculous. They knocked you about last time. Don&apos;t\u00a0go.&quot; So I got a bit bossy. He gets 600 emails a day. And\u00a0he helps something like two to\u00a0three and a half thousand people a year with all their particular problems. And I think even he&apos;s aware that it&apos;s tiring and that he doesn&apos;t get enough support.<br /><strong>Did you go on somewhere? </strong>We\u00a0stayed until half past one. I\u00a0stood around waiting for a cab for\u00a010 minutes and Peter went off on\u00a0his bike.<br /><strong>Marks out of 10? </strong>Oooh, 9. I really enjoyed it. I had an impression of Peter \u2013 based on what I&apos;d seen on TV\u00a0\u2013 that he was a bit overly serious. He&apos;s\u00a0actually not like that.\u00a0I had an\u00a0impression of him that was fairly\u00a0narrow and he is actually much more rounded. We\u00a0got on really well. <br /><strong>Would you meet again? </strong>Yes. We&apos;ve been emailing and it would be nice to go out for dinner. I&apos;m interested in the work he does. He has dedicated most of his life to representing other people for almost nothing and gets no recognition at\u00a0all.

He has been single for\u00a0three years. <p><strong>Did you recognise him? </strong>We recognised each other instantly. It\u00a0was a pleasant surprise to see Richard. I was dreading being paired up with some awful, snooty, brain-dead queen or someone I&apos;d tried dating in the past and who&apos;d given me the brushoff. Our paths had crossed at Moscow Gay Pride in 2007, when both of us were bashed by neo-Nazis. It was nice to see Richard without blood on his face. Much more handsome.<br /><strong>First impressions? </strong>Very smiley and welcoming. Immediately, I felt at ease. I thought to myself: this is going to be fun. He was charming, witty, stylishly dressed and has a great physique, with macho arms to\u00a0die for. He struck me as very intelligent and well read, as I expected \u2013 not an airhead pop star.<br /><strong>What did you talk about? </strong>Richard can talk \u2013 and talk! We obviously had\u00a0a good time, because our dinner lasted over four hours; conversing about his music and my human rights work, the election and the new government, the state of gay rights and the downsides of the gay\u00a0scene and culture. We shared a\u00a0critique of its\u00a0sometimes shallow, me-first, consumerist, materialistic mentality. The only surprise was that Richard voted Ukip \u2013 on democratic and libertarian grounds, he said. He, more than me, chatted about ex-boyfriends.<br /><strong>Any awkward moments? </strong>No awkward or dull moments. We got on really well, but more as friends than as people dating.<br /><strong>Best thing about him? </strong>He&apos;s very smart and articulate, well rounded and grounded.<br /><strong>Did you go on somewhere? </strong>We\u00a0walked together to Waterloo; parting with a hug and kiss (sans tongues). He got a taxi. I rode off on\u00a0my bicycle.<br /><strong>Marks out of 10? </strong>8. He&apos;d make a\u00a0good boyfriend, definitely.<br /><strong>Would you meet again? </strong>I&apos;d like to keep in touch with Richard. We have very hectic lives and commitments, with lots of travel. If we were partners, when would we ever see each other? Richard likes skinny men, so that&apos;s me. But we both have\u00a0a recent history of younger partners. I am open to the possibility of dating someone in their 50s, but it is probably a bit of a challenge for him and for me.</p> <p>Richard and Peter ate at <a href=\"http://www.harveynichols.com/output/Page128.asp\" title=\"\">Oxo Tower\u00a0Restaurant</a>, London SE1<strong>.</strong></p>"}, "sectionId": "lifeandstyle", "id": "lifeandstyle/2010/jun/19/date-peter-tatchell-richard-fairbrass", "webTitle": "Celebrity blind date: Richard Fairbrass and Peter Tatchell"}, {"isHosted": false, "sectionName": "Life and style", "type": "article", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jun/19/lembit-opik-abi-titmuss-date", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jun/19/lembit-opik-abi-titmuss-date", "webPublicationDate": "2010-06-18T23:03:07Z", "fields": {"body": "<h2>Lembit Opik, 45</h2> <p>Liberal Democrat MP for Montgomeryshire in Wales from 1997, until he lost his seat in last month&apos;s general election.

She\u00a0said, &quot;Hi, I&apos;m Abi&quot;, and I said, &quot;Yeah, I know.&quot;<br /><strong>First impressions? </strong>I was really pleased, actually, because I&apos;ve always liked her from a distance. She always struck me as a decent person, and I was relieved it wasn&apos;t\u00a0somebody who either I didn&apos;t like or I knew didn&apos;t like me.<br /><strong>What did you talk about? </strong>Everything: the food, her new puppy, media coverage, the show she&apos;s performing in at the moment, the sort of things I do. We\u00a0compared notes on what we have in common, like being in the press quite a lot and being reported in certain ways.<br /><strong>Any awkward moments? </strong>I was nervous before I arrived, because I&apos;m always nervous in that\u00a0sort of situation. Within a\u00a0few\u00a0moments, I&apos;d\u00a0calmed down. In\u00a0certain circumstances, I&apos;m still 15\u00a0years old. So, apart from my natural and slightly nervous manner\u00a0in a new situation like that, I\u00a0felt at ease. In\u00a0fact, I was actually really sad when it finished. It just went so fast.<br /><strong>Good table manners? </strong>Yes, better than mine. She&apos;s got poise and\u00a0she&apos;s very graceful. I&apos;m glad I\u00a0didn&apos;t order\u00a0spaghetti because I\u00a0made enough of a mess of what I\u00a0did eat.<br /><strong>Best thing about her? </strong>Her enthusiasm. She&apos;s not a passenger in\u00a0her life: she&apos;s a fully signed-up member of the human race. I just found that a very attractive quality. She has a warmth and innocence which is beguiling.<br /><strong>Did you go on somewhere? </strong>No \u2013 she\u00a0needed to go. <br /><strong>Marks out of 10? </strong>9. I&apos;m taking a\u00a0point off for my table manners. She didn&apos;t do anything wrong.

When my taxi came, we were almost disappointed. We\u00a0got on like a house on fire. He&apos;s\u00a0really interesting and a very intelligent man. We talked about flying, because he&apos;s got a plane and has been a pilot for about 20 years, and I&apos;ve been in helicopters and private jets. I wanted to know all about the\u00a0people he&apos;d met, so <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/mikhailgorbachev\" title=\"\">Gorbachev</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/benazir-bhutto\" title=\"\">Benazir Bhutto</a> and all of those.

We were chatting away.<br /><strong>Good table manners? </strong>His were impeccable. I was glad he ordered his steak rare. That&apos;s a good sign in a\u00a0man. That&apos;s how I order my steaks.<br /><strong>Best thing about him? </strong>His conversation. He&apos;s very interesting and he\u00a0seemed like quite a sweet-natured man.<br /><strong>Did you go on somewhere? </strong>No.<br /><strong>Marks out of 10? </strong>I&apos;d give it an 8.
